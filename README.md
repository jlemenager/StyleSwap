## Overview
Your one-stop-shop social media site that allows users to view other users' new outfit ideas and buy/sell those users' new outfits secondhand. We hope to allow users to share and view new fashion trends in an inclusive and creative way, all while supporting secondhand shopping. It's never a bad idea to Swap your Style!

As you view our front page you will see a newsfeed populate on your right, displaying all of the users' most recent image posts of their new outfit. You can then buy any item from that image (if that user happens to be selling any item in the picture).

There will be a navigation bar that displays the homepage(newsfeed), the marketplace(secondhand items for sale from various users), an about link to display info about StyleSwap, a cart, and user info settings.

Our homepage and marketplace will both have search bar functionality, allowing you to search for specific items by keyword to view and buy respectively.

## Getting Started

Technologies Required: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Github Version Control, and Figma
Here is how we will begin to execute this project:

We plan to incorporate these two designs to create a seamless transition between the newsfeed and the marketplace:

Check out our UHD of our frontend functionality here (note we are not including the logic connecting the post and marketplace as that is a stretch goal and overcomplicates our current process):
